					<h3>Subjects of Study</h3>
					<p>
					At the awesome sciene faculty, we have a pretty open-minded reasearch faculty - as long as the subjects fall
					somewhere un the realtm of science and technology. You eem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just
					the kind of person we'd like to haev on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intreigued
					by are as follows, in oroder of priority:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benifits of Resveratrol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)</li>
						<li>Measuring the effects of performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30<sup>0</sup>C (86<sup>0</sup>F)
							when the audience size exponentially increases ( effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>)</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
					So, lease can you provide more information on each of these subjects including how long you'd 
					expect the reseach to take, required staff and other resource and anything else you think we;d need
					to know? Thanks.
					</p>

					<h3>Exotic dane moves</h3>
					Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, <b>I</b><i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances.To answer your questions,
					my favourite dances were are follows, with definitions:
					<dl>
						<dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
						<dd>A little known but <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole 
						villate would dance around a cilcle like chickens, to encorace their livestock to be "fruitful".
						</dd>
						<dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
						<dd>
							Before the icelanders developer fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practie the dance,
							which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffing their bodies around
							a imperceptibly tiny, vary rapid movements. One of my felow students used to say that he thought 
							dance inspired mordern styles suck as Twerking
						</dd>
					</dl>
					<p>For more details of my research, see my <a href="https://www.google.com">exotic dance research page</a></p>
					<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
					<p>Dr Eleanor Gaye</p>
